\usage{
get_distribution(
  taxon,
  rank = c("species", "genus", "family", "order", "higher"),
  native = TRUE,
  introduced = TRUE,
  extinct = TRUE,
  location_doubtful = TRUE,
  wcvp_names = NULL,
  wcvp_distributions = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxon}{Character. The taxon to be mapped.}

\item{rank}{Character. One of "species", "genus", "family", "order" or "higher", giving the rank of the value in \code{taxon}.}

\item{native}{Logical. Include native range? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{introduced}{Logical. Include introduced range? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{extinct}{Logical. Include extinct range? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{location_doubtful}{Logical. Include occurrences that are thought to be
doubtful? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{wcvp_names}{A data frame of taxonomic names from WCVP version 7 or later.
If \code{NULL}, names will be loaded from \link[rWCVPdata:wcvp_names]{rWCVPdata::wcvp_names}.}

\item{wcvp_distributions}{A data frame of distributions from WCVP version 7 or later.
If \code{NULL}, distributions will be loaded from \link[rWCVPdata:wcvp_names]{rWCVPdata::wcvp_names}.}
}
\value{
sf data.frame containing the range polygon/s of the taxon.
}
\description{
Generate spatial distribution objects for species, genera or families
}
\details{
Where \link{rank} is higher than species, the distribution of the whole group will be returned, not individual species within that group. This also applies when toggling options - for example, introduced occurrences will only be included if they are outside the native range, regardless of whether \code{native=TRUE} or \code{native=FALSE}. To plot extinctions, introductions or doubtful occurrences within the native range, the \code{summary_table} and \code{generate_occurrence_matrix} functions can be used.
